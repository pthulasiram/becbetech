## What is JSON?

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a text-based representation of structured data that is based on key-value pairs and ordered lists. JSON is commonly, but not exclusively, used to exchange information between web clients and web servers. JSON is derived from JavaScript, and is supported either natively or through libraries in most major programming languages.

JSON is a generic data format with a minimal number of value types: strings, numbers, booleans, lists, objects, and null. Although the notation is a subset of JavaScript, these types are represented in all common programming languages, making JSON a good candidate to transmit data across language gaps.

## JSON : JavaScript Object Notation

Let’s try to explore JSON and how we can define it. In general, JSON is a lightweight object format, is used to store data and transport over the network.

JSON stores data in the form of properties. Each property consists of key and value and enclosed with “”.

### Syntax

```json
{
  "key": "value"
}
```

### Example

```json
{
  "tool": "jsonformatter.dev"
}
```

## JSON Syntax Rules

- Data is in name/value pairs
- Data is separated by commas
- Curly braces hold objects
- Square brackets hold arrays
